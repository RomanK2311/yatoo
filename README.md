# Yatoo - yet another todo app

**This is still in a very early stage of development. Lots of planned features are not available yet!**

Never waste time thinking about what you could do next. Yatoo's filter system shows you only what is relevant at the moment. It lets you get things done efficiently. Your todo list will stop growing infinitely.
